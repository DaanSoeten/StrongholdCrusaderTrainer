# Stronghold Crusader Trainer
This a simple trainer I made for a game called Stronghold Crusader.  
It's available on steam [here](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40970/).

### Features
Set the following values:
- Gold
- Chickens/Skips
- Wood
- Stone
- Iron
- Pitch
- Bread
- Cheese
- Apples
- Meat
- Hops
- Ale
- Wheat
- Bows
- Crossbows

- Pikes
- Maces
- Swords
- Leather Armor
- Iron Armor

There are options available to automatically add goods depending on the amount of that good that's available in your stockpile. Each button adds 100 of that specific good. 

### How to use
Start the game, start the trainer. Press buttons. Easy as that!

### Cheat Table
This repository also includes the original cheat table, so if you're just looking for that you could use it aswell.
